<ol>
<li>Devotion to God:
<ol>
<li>Sincere desire to please or glorify God.</li>
<li>Action motivated by our love or God, our out of a sense of obedience to Him.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Often however, we are not motivated by devotion to God. (Potiphar’s wife: Gen 39:9; Gen 22:12; Mat 22:37—40)</li>
</ol>
<p>• “The fear of consequences may keep us from committing the outward acts of murder or adultery, but only love will keep us from committing murder or adultery in our hearts” (52).</p>
<p>Other Scriptures: 1 Cor 10:31; Col 3:22; 1 Pet 2:13; Eph 5:21</p>
<p>(Gen 22:12) Abraham was led by his obedience to God. We see this in his sensitivity to God&rsquo;s voice. While at one time, this voice had commanded him to sacrifice his son, which would have been disobeying God&rsquo;s will if he had carried it out. I am not sure how this comes about, Abraham is obedient to God&rsquo;s current command which in itself undermines His previous command to Abraham. Either way, this shows complete obedience. Additionally, there was a time when I had just moved to some place new, that I felt God had told me to move to. However, I also felt Him telling me to turn around and that I had shown myself to be faithful. I never did turn around and to this day I am not sure whether or not I was supposed to.</p>
<p>(Gensis 39:9) Joseph states that he is not afraid of Pharoh, but rather its his fear of God that keeps him from giving into temptation. I would love to be able to stand in front of the ruler of the world and say to him &ldquo;I am not afraid of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Matt 22:37&ndash;40) Our motivation must be our love of God. Love I think often comes with fear as well. I imagine a son who both loved and fear his father is probably intimately familiar with this conflict in emotions. However, our emotion is not only love of God, but also love for our neighbors. I think that this is one that over the past couple of years, the church more broadly has really been confronted by. But, our understanding of God&rsquo;s scripture should be founded on these two commandments. Every other commandment reduces in some way down to these two.</p>
<p>Rico Vitz in his paper &ldquo;What is a Merciful Heart?&rdquo; argues that what Christ commands us, is to &ldquo;strive to cultivate a merciful heart, one disposed to the kind of affective depth described by St. Isaac of Syria&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is the heart&rsquo;s <em>burning desire</em> for the sake of the entire creation, for men, for birds, for animals, for demons, and for every created thing; and at the recollection and sight of them, the eyes of a merciful man pour forth abundant tears. From the <em>strong and vehement mercy</em> that grips his heart and from his <em>great compassion</em>, his heart is <em>humbled</em>, and he cannot bear to hear or to see any injury or slight sorrow in creation. For this reason, he <em>offers up prayers with tears continually</em> even for irrational beasts, for the enemies of the truth, and for those who harm him, that they may be protected and receive mercy. And in like manner he even prays for the family of reptiles, because of the <em>great compassion</em> that burns without measure in his <em>heart in the likeness of God</em>. St. Isaac of Syria (c. 613&ndash;700 A.D.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We often focus on the cognitive faculties involved in feeling compassion towards others, but how often do we engage, or are moved by the irrational, non-cognitive faculties in our love for others. Pastor Curtis gave a sermon on this two years ago I think. Like Vitz, Pastor Curtis highlighted the part in the scriptures (John 11:17&ndash;35) where Jesus wept over Lazarus' death even though he knew that he would end up raising Lazarus from the dead. Vitz argues that Jesus was moved to tears not by Lazarus' death, but by the sorrow the others were feeling. I need to work on this because it is difficult for me to experience the emotions felt by others.</p>
<ul>
<li>compassionate (moved irrationally in his benevolence):
<ul>
<li>for those who were hungry (Matt 15:32; Mark 8:2)</li>
<li>in debt (Matt 18:27)</li>
<li>harassed and dejected (Matt 9:36)</li>
<li>sick (Matt 14:14)</li>
<li>disabled (Matt 20:34)</li>
<li>infirm (Mark 1:41)</li>
<li>spiritually adrift (mark 6:36)</li>
<li>grieving (Luke 7:13)</li>

<li>Developing godly character traits entails putting off and putting on character traits. (57):
<ol>
<li>Put off the old self and on the new self (Ep. 4:22—24; 4:28—5:4):
<ol>
<li>Put off falsehood and put on truthfulness (57).</li>

<li>For instance, do not fall into the trap of identifying your areas of need in the development of your Christian character. This will cause you to diffuse your spiritual injuries over much too broad an area (64).</li>
</ol>
<p>This is close to some thoughts I’ve had recently.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As you study the twelve different traits of godly character, each one with several different potential applications, you could easily end up with a list of twenty or so areas of need in which you should grow in Christian character (64).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had gotten stuck in this rut where I kept attempting to identify actions and behaviors that I should stop performing. But this list only kept growing because every new action or behavior would not only fail the replace the one before it, but would only make it longer.</p>
<p>Which I guess makes sense when you think about all of the possible actions, behaviors one can perform. Then think about the various contexts in which you might perform an action. Some actions may be appropriate, godly even in one context, for instance throwing over the money exchangers tables, which might be sinful in another, say throwing over the tables at a birthday party.</p>
<p>Finally, the thought popped into my head, stop focusing on what not to do and focus on what you can do, what would be good in this situation to do, what is a good thing you can do for your children/wife/friend right now?</p>
