# Lesson 3 Developing a Godly Character

1. There are two distinct but complementary traits which form the foundation for godliness:
   1. God-centeredness (chs 3 and 4): devotion to God.
   2. Godlikeness: The development of Godlike character.
2. What are some character traits of the Godly person?
   1. (Gal 5:22—23): love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control, holiness, humility, compassion, forbearance, contentment, thankfulness, considerateness, sincerity and perseverance.
3. There are two important factors in the development of such a character:
   1. These character traits are the fruits of the Holy Spirit within us which is the result of God’s work in us.
   2. Us fulfilling our responsibility under his direction and by his enabling.

## Some Basic Principles for the Foundation of a Godly Character

### 1. The right motive:

1. Devotion to God:
   1. Sincere desire to please or glorify God.
   2. Action motivated by our love or God, our out of a sense of obedience to Him.
2. Often however, we are not motivated by devotion to God. (Potiphar’s wife: Gen 39:9; Gen 22:12; Mat 22:37—40)

• “The fear of consequences may keep us from committing the outward acts of murder or adultery, but only love will keep us from committing murder or adultery in our hearts” (52).

Other Scriptures: 1 Cor 10:31; Col 3:22; 1 Pet 2:13; Eph 5:21

(Gen 22:12) Abraham was led by his obedience to God. We see this in his sensitivity to God's voice. While at one time, this voice had commanded him to sacrifice his son, which would have been disobeying God's will if he had carried it out. I am not sure how this comes about, Abraham is obedient to God's current command which in itself undermines His previous command to Abraham. Either way, this shows complete obedience. Additionally, there was a time when I had just moved to some place new, that I felt God had told me to move to. However, I also felt Him telling me to turn around and that I had shown myself to be faithful. I never did turn around and to this day I am not sure whether or not I was supposed to.

(Gensis 39:9) Joseph states that he is not afraid of Pharoh, but rather its his fear of God that keeps him from giving into temptation. I would love to be able to stand in front of the ruler of the world and say to him "I am not afraid of you."

(Matt 22:37--40) Our motivation must be our love of God. Love I think often comes with fear as well. I imagine a son who both loved and fear his father is probably intimately familiar with this conflict in emotions. However, our emotion is not only love of God, but also love for our neighbors. I think that this is one that over the past couple of years, the church more broadly has really been confronted by. But, our understanding of God's scripture should be founded on these two commandments. Every other commandment reduces in some way down to these two.

Rico Vitz in his paper "What is a Merciful Heart?" argues that what Christ commands us, is to "strive to cultivate a merciful heart, one disposed to the kind of affective depth described by St. Isaac of Syria"

> It is the heart's *burning desire* for the sake of the entire creation, for men, for birds, for animals, for demons, and for every created thing; and at the recollection and sight of them, the eyes of a merciful man pour forth abundant tears. From the *strong and vehement mercy* that grips his heart and from his *great compassion*, his heart is *humbled*, and he cannot bear to hear or to see any injury or slight sorrow in creation. For this reason, he *offers up prayers with tears continually* even for irrational beasts, for the enemies of the truth, and for those who harm him, that they may be protected and receive mercy. And in like manner he even prays for the family of reptiles, because of the *great compassion* that burns without measure in his *heart in the likeness of God*. St. Isaac of Syria (c. 613--700 A.D.)

We often focus on the cognitive faculties involved in feeling compassion towards others, but how often do we engage, or are moved by the irrational, non-cognitive faculties in our love for others. Pastor Curtis gave a sermon on this two years ago I think. Like Vitz, Pastor Curtis highlighted the part in the scriptures (John 11:17--35) where Jesus wept over Lazarus' death even though he knew that he would end up raising Lazarus from the dead. Vitz argues that Jesus was moved to tears not by Lazarus' death, but by the sorrow the others were feeling. I need to work on this because it is difficult for me to experience the emotions felt by others.

* compassionate (moved irrationally in his benevolence):
  * for those who were hungry (Matt 15:32; Mark 8:2)
  * in debt (Matt 18:27)
  * harassed and dejected (Matt 9:36)
  * sick (Matt 14:14)
  * disabled (Matt 20:34)
  * infirm (Mark 1:41)
  * spiritually adrift (mark 6:36)
  * grieving (Luke 7:13)

### 2. The Source of Power

1. The risen Christ enables the power, or enablement for a godly life. (see 2 Cor 3:5; Col 1:29; Phi 4:13)
2. The way we experience 1, is through a relationship with Christ.:
   1. (John 15) and Col 2:6—7: Living in Christ means:
      1. Setting dependence on our own wisdom and strength of character (Psalm 119:33—37)
      2. Beholding the glory of Christ in His word (54). (See 2 Cor 3:18)

### 3. Responsibility and Dependence

1. “though the power for godly character comes from Christ, the responsibility for developing and displaying that character is ours” (55).
   1. Developing the fruit of the Spirit is either the work of the Holy Spirit
   2. Or it is the work of the Christian. (Gal 5; Phi 3:12—14; Phi 2:12—13)
   3. But it is the Holy Spirit, God’s work in us that enables us to fulfill the fruits of the spirit.

### 4. Put Off and Put On

1. Developing godly character traits entails putting off and putting on character traits. (57):
   1. Put off the old self and on the new self (Ep. 4:22—24; 4:28—5:4):
      1. Put off falsehood and put on truthfulness (57).
      2. Off: Unwholesome speech; On: Edification of others
      3. Off: Bitterness, rage, anger, and slander; On: kindness, compassion, forgiveness
      4. Off: Obscene or suggestive speech; On: thanksgiving
   2. Hate what is evil and love what is good (Rom 12:9).
2. Requires more than putting off sin:
   1. Someone who only focuses on not sinning may miss the gracious qualities of love, joy, and compassion.
3. Do no however loose focus of avoiding sin.

### 5. Balanced Growth

1. Pursue growth in the fruits of the Holy Spirit:
   1. Often we tend to emphasize our natural dispositions.:
      1. Sanguine easily responds to admonition to rejoice, or be compassionate and tenderhearted but finds it difficult exercise self-control or be dependable.
      2. phlegmatic: need for faithfulness but difficulty with fruit of joy.
      3. choleric: self-disciplined but lacks patience and gentleness with others
      4. melancholic: empathic and self-sacrificing but highly critical and unforgiving

### 6. Growth is Progressive

1. Growth is progressive, i.e. never complete. (1 Thess 4:9—10)
2. Growth is necessary for spiritual survival
   1. 1 Tim 4:7; Heb 5:14; 12:11; 2 Peter 2:14. We have to continue to grow in our Godly character because if we do not, then we will grow in some other area that is not godly.
   2. The relationship because conduct and character is an intimate one; manifests in the form of repeated actions over time and conduct produces character. (Rom 6:19)

• The story about Paul gathering wood rather than merely warming himself by the fire after he’d been shipwrecked is very good. (Acts 20:33—35; 1 Th 2:7—9)

### Form Reasonable Expectations

1. For instance, do not fall into the trap of identifying your areas of need in the development of your Christian character. This will cause you to diffuse your spiritual injuries over much too broad an area (64).

This is close to some thoughts I’ve had recently.

> As you study the twelve different traits of godly character, each one with several different potential applications, you could easily end up with a list of twenty or so areas of need in which you should grow in Christian character (64).

I had gotten stuck in this rut where I kept attempting to identify actions and behaviors that I should stop performing. But this list only kept growing because every new action or behavior would not only fail the replace the one before it, but would only make it longer. 

Which I guess makes sense when you think about all of the possible actions, behaviors one can perform. Then think about the various contexts in which you might perform an action. Some actions may be appropriate, godly even in one context, for instance throwing over the money exchangers tables, which might be sinful in another, say throwing over the tables at a birthday party.

Finally, the thought popped into my head, stop focusing on what not to do and focus on what you can do, what would be good in this situation to do, what is a good thing you can do for your children/wife/friend right now?
