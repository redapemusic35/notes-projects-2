  description: |
    David Lewis (1941â€“2001) was one of the most important philosophers of the 20th Century. He made significant contributions to philosophy of language, philosophy of mathematics, philosophy of science, decision theory, epistemology, meta-ethics and aesthetics. In most of these fields he is essential reading; in many of them he is among the most important figures of recent decades. And this list leaves out his two most significant contributions. (Brian Weatherson, [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/david-lewis/))
