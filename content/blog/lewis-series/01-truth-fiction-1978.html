<p>“But what should we do with a fiction that is not blatantly false, but false only because an author has been forgetful”? (truth and fiction, 46) In other words, why can’t we ascribe the same subject-predicate form as parallel descriptions of real-life characters; such that it would be false to say “Holmes wears a silk top hat” in the same way that it would be false to say “Nixon wears a silk top hat.”</p>
<p>As it stands now, several difficulties arise in doing so:</p>
<ul>
<li>In some ways, Holmes is a real-life person of flesh and blood as is Nixon.</li>
<li>How many members are there in Sir Joseph’s chorus, <em>five</em>? <em>fifty</em>?</li>
<li>What restricts ranges of quantification.</li>
<li>Finally, why are fictional characters immune to inferred consequences?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>. . . the Meinongian must tell us why truths about fictional characters are cut off, sometimes though not always, from the consequences they ought to imply (37).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer to this question, argues Lewis is that we must first abstract away from the original to several of the possible revisions that remain closest to the original.</p>

<p>Lets say that at <span class="math inline">\(w_{1}\)</span>, “Baker Street” is closer to “Paddington” than it is to “Waterloo.” Also at <span class="math inline">\(w_{1}\)</span> Sherlock Holmes has <span class="math inline">\(10^{5}\)</span> number of hairs on his head. While we might think that in the actual world <span class="math inline">\(w_{0}\)</span>, it is also true that “Baker Street” is closer to “Paddington” than it is to “Waterloo,” but this gives us no reason to think that Sherlock Holmes has <span class="math inline">\(10^{5}\)</span> number of hairs on his head. Therefore there are a number of truths <span class="math inline">\(\psi^{1-n}\)</span> which hold at <span class="math inline">\(w_{1}\)</span>.</p>

<p>The above is wrong because Sherlock Holmes does not appear to have <span class="math inline">\(10_{5}\)</span> number of hairs on his head. What this unfortunate sequence looks like is:</p>
<div id="the-reality-principle" class="section level2">
<h2>The Reality Principle</h2>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(p_{1}, . . . p_{n}\)</span> are the propositions whose fictionality a representation generates directly, another proposition, <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>, is fictional in it if, and only if, were it the case that <span class="math inline">\(p_{1}, . . . p_{n}\)</span>, it would be the case that <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{\psi^{1}, . . ., \psi^{n}}{\therefore\phi}\]</span></p>
<p>Where there is a <span class="math inline">\(w_{n}\)</span> between <span class="math inline">\(w_{1-n}\)</span> at which <span class="math inline">\(\neg\psi\land\phi\)</span>. You might think that there is no reason to think that Sherlock Holmes has <span class="math inline">\(10^{5}\)</span> number of hairs on his head anywhere in the set <span class="math inline">\(\psi_{1-n}\)</span> but if this is true, then it does not answer those cases where:</p>
<ul>
<li>Holmes lived on Baker Street (which is not nearer Paddington Station than it is Waterloo Station in the actual world <span class="math inline">\(w_{0}\)</span>)</li>
<li>Holmes lived nearer to Paddington Station than Waterloo Station</li>
<li>Holmes was just a person—a person of flesh and blood (Not person of flesh and blood at <span class="math inline">\(w_{0}\)</span>)</li>
<li>Holmes really existed (doesn’t exist?)</li>
</ul>
<p>The interpreter of the fiction is to ask: “what the real world would be like if the propositions (as a whole within fiction) whose fictionality is generated directly were true: What else would be true if they were?”</p>
<p>We can possibly amend this problem by prefixing an operator; say “In the fiction <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> . . .”, to each premiss and to the conclusion of the original arguments.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{In f, \psi^{1}, . . ., In f, \psi^{n}}{\therefore In f, \phi}\]</span></p>
