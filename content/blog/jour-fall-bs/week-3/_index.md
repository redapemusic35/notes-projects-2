  Humility, is central to relationship. To God, to ourselves, to others. Humility towards God and others, is exercised through our trials, blessings, abilities, and achievements. We approach our relationships via humility. In other words, humility is undefinable, described and understood only by our lives. (Loosely paraphrased from page 69.)

    Humility manifests itself in our relationships---to God, to ourselves, to others. We are to be humble toward God and His word, humble in regard to trials and blessings that come our way, or abilities and achievements with which we are blessed, and humble toward other people. Humility is the proper attitude with which to approach all these relationships and circumstances. Like love, it defies adequate definition; it can be described and understood only as it is applied to everyday living. (Practices of Godliness, 69)
