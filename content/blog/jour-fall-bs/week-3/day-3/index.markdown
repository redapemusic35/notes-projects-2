# Chapter Outline

God commends the humble person.^[See Isaiah 57:15; and 66:1--2] God esteems those who are humble, promising to dwell with them, bestowing grace to them and exalting them.^[Also see James 4:6; 1 Peter 5:6; Luke 18:14] Also humility opens the way for the other virtues, assuming these are relational, it the way in which we cultivate our relationships with God, ourselves and others.

## Trembling at God's Word 

Is this how we should view our own unhealthy relationships with our neighbors? What is interesting about such an approach, is that the neighbors in such cases were not often considered moral agents in the same sense as the Israelites. While they might have been agents of God's wrath, assuming that Israel repented of its various sins, God then would give the Israelites victory over the neighbor. 

Is this what we should pray for concerning our own unhealthy relationships? That God give us victory over our neighbors? I don't think so, unless victory means the neighbor coming to full knowledge and recognition of God's goodness, and into a relationship with Him. So the way in which the analogy would hold given the redeeming work of Christ, is that Israel's neighbors rather than being destroyed, would instead be redeemed by the awe inspiring redemption of Christ's sacrifice on the cross.
