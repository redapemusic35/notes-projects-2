# Chapter Outline

God commends the humble person.^[See Isaiah 57:15; and 66:1--2] God esteems those who are humble, promising to dwell with them, bestowing grace to them and exalting them.^[Also see James 4:6; 1 Peter 5:6; Luke 18:14] Also humility opens the way for the other virtues, assuming these are relational, it the way in which we cultivate our relationships with God, ourselves and others.

## Humility Before God

Humility begins with the fear of God and characterizes every aspect of every relationship we have with others. 

1. In healthy relationships with others, we humbly receive the blessings of such relationships as coming from God.
2. In unhealthy relationships, we "are to humbly accept them as from an infinitely wise and living heavenly Father."

I have no qualms with 1, but 2 seems strange. For instance, is there an extent to where we accept these as coming from the Father. Possibly, what is not mentioned are those unhealthy relationships Israel had with its neighbors. Often these were approached from the position of a recognition of sin on Israel's part, meaning that Israel often viewed these unhealthy relationships as a correction, or opportunity for growth given some past sin.

For instance, see David's Prayer in Psalm 5:

```{r echo=F}

blogdown::quote_poem(c("Listen to my words, O Lord Consider my groaning and sighing.", "Heed the sound of my cry for help, my King and my God,
For to You I pray.", "In the morning, O Lord, You will hear my voice;
In the morning I will prepare [a prayer and a sacrifice] for You and watch and wait [for You to speak to my heart].", "For You are not a God who takes pleasure in wickedness; No evil [person] dwells with You.", "The boastful and the arrogant will not stand in Your sight;
You hate all who do evil.", "You destroy those who tell lies;
The Lord detests and rejects the bloodthirsty and deceitful man.", "But as for me, I will enter Your house through the abundance of Your steadfast love and tender mercy;
At Your holy temple I will bow [obediently] in reverence for You.", "O Lord, lead me in Your righteousness because of my enemies;
Make Your way straight (direct, right) before me.", "For there is nothing trustworthy or reliable or truthful in what they say;
Their heart is destruction [just a treacherous chasm, a yawning gulf of lies].
Their throat is an open grave;
They [glibly] flatter with their [silken] tongue.","Hold them guilty, O God;
Let them fall by their own designs and councils!
Cast them out because of the abundance of their transgressions,
For they are mutinous and have rebelled against You.","
But let all who take refuge and put their trust in You rejoice,
Let them ever sing for joy;
Because You cover and shelter them,
Let those who love Your name be joyful and exult in You.","For You, O Lord, bless the righteous man [the one who is in right standing with You];
You surround him with favor as with a shield.")

Is this how we should view our own unhealthy relationships with our neighbors? What is interesting about such an approach, is that the neighbors in such cases were not often considered moral agents in the same sense as the Israelites. While they might have been agents of God's wrath, assuming that Israel repented of its various sins, God then would give the Israelites victory over the neighbor. 

Is this what we should pray for concerning our own unhealthy relationships? That God give us victory over our neighbors? I don't think so, unless victory means the neighbor coming to full knowledge and recognition of God's goodness, and into a relationship with Him. So the way in which the analogy would hold given the redeeming work of Christ, is that Israel's neighbors rather than being destroyed, would instead be redeemed by the awe inspiring redemption of Christ's sacrifice on the cross.
