The following is a summary of examples of Humility as expressed by Jesus:

Matt 11:28--30. Not sure what the example of humility as it is shown here. Here are some attempts: 

* Jesus invites others to lay their burdens on him. "Come to me all of you who are weary . . ." etc. Maybe from anyone else this would be ambitious? Knowing that your friend is experiencing a period of hardship, you say to them: if you need to talk, you know where I live. But then maybe this is saying something more, as in "come on, I know a great place where we can go to talk, I promise you'll feel better."

Matt 20:28. "That's the way it is with the son of man, he did not come to be served but to serve."

* This is undoubtedly a possible example of humility on the assumption that it is sincere. I think that it is safe to say that this is sincere since before it, Jesus is calling on His disciples to follow the example which he has just set continually before this. He is admonishing the disciples who had been fighting over who would have the highest position of honor in the world to come.

Luke 2:7; 2:51. verse 7 recounts Jesus's birth in a manger while 51 tells anecdotally of Jesus's obedience to his parents. 

John 13:1--5. It seems that here, there is an instance wherein Jesus's actions upon his knowledge of Judas' betrayal can be contrasted against say a death row inmate, or political prisoner. For instance, Socrates famously was forced to drink Hemlock. His final actions consisted of acceptance, and a final act to pontificate among his followers in dramatic fashion. A death row inmate might order hundreds of dollars worth of food, in the end refusing to even take a bite of it. A political prisoner might make one last appeal, or making a series of statements intended to convince the world of his moral superiority. However, Jesus rather than waxing poetic in the hour of his impeding death, choose instead to personally show what humility looked like.
