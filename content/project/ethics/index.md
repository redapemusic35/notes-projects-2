Hopefully this will allow you to access course content quickly and easily. It is easier for me to maintain and you might have found that it was simply a click from Canvas. I will post the weekly assignments and lecture slides and notes from the previous week. The 5 numbers at the end of the links under "Lecture slides and notes" correspond to the Monday of the week's lectures comprising that slide.
